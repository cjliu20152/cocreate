                        The Full Motion Video (FMV) Content-Based Retrieval and Access (COBRA) MIP project is using the ERF Lab's high-performance Hadoop cluster to process 169 MPEG files, consisting of 1,721,532 H.264 video frames and 253,496 asynchronous KLV metadata packets collected from Predator drones operated by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. The cameras include: "EO Nose", "EO Spotter", "EO Zoom (DLTV)", and "IR InSb" [EO: Electro-Optical, DLTV: DayLight TeleVision, IR: InfraRed; InSb: Indium Stibium]. Over 90% of the frames were captured by the IR camera. The median ground sample distance for the frames is 0.6 meters (432 meters over 720 pixels). Processing includes feature detection/description (e.g. 1,634,272,106 SIFT descriptors), motion detection, clustering to form visual words, and pattern recognition model construction/evaluation.

                        <p>GPS trajectory dataset was collected in (Microsoft Research Asia) Geolife project by 182 users in a period of over five years (from April 2007 to August 2012). A GPS trajectory of this dataset is represented by a sequence of time-stamped points, each of which contains the information of latitude, longitude and altitude. This dataset contains 17,621 trajectories with a total distance of 1,292,951 kilometers and a total duration of 50,176 hours. These trajectories were recorded by different GPS loggers and GPS-phones, and have a variety of sampling rates. 91.5 percent of the trajectories are logged in a dense representation, e.g. every 1~5 seconds or every 5~10 meters per point.</p>
                        <p>This dataset recoded a broad range of usersâ€™ outdoor movements, including not only life routines like go home and go to work but also some entertainments and sports activities, such as shopping, sightseeing, dining, hiking, and cycling. This trajectory dataset can be used in many research fields, such as mobility pattern mining, user activity recognition, location-based social networks, location privacy, and location recommendation.</p>
                        <p>Although this dataset is wildly distributed in over 30 cities of China and even in some cities located in the USA and Europe, the majority of the data was created in Beijing, China.</p>
